# blockchain_rust

Simple blockchain project based on this one: https://github.com/Jeiwan/blockchain_go

This project is for self learning purposes only. To better understand concepts of blockchain and rust language.

## TODO
* Code cleaning - when this was written, I've just started learning Rust language, so many places could be made better
* Add some kind of threadpool in server
* There are lots of places where large objects are copied
* Make real p2p network
